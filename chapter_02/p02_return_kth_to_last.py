"""
Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but 
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to 
that node. 
EXAMPLE 
lnput:the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f 
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a ->b->d->e->f
